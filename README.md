# ChatApplication
School Project network technologies
Overview
The ChatApplication is a simple console-based chat client-server application developed in Java. It allows users to connect to a server, send messages, and receive responses in real time. This application demonstrates the basic principles of network communication and client-server architecture.

Features
Real-time communication: Allows clients to send and receive messages via a socket connection to a server.
Multi-threaded: The client runs two threads simultaneouslyâ€”one to handle incoming messages from the server and another to capture user input from the console.
Graceful termination: The client can exit the chat session by typing the quit command.
Technologies Used

Java: Core programming language.
Sockets: Utilizes Java's Socket class to establish a connection between the client and server.
Multithreading: Separate threads for reading and writing messages to ensure real-time communication.
